        <h3>ER Model and Relational Algebra</h3>
        <p>
          This is an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram used for database modeling. Its purpose is to represent the structure and relationships between various entities in a business context, such as employees, departments, projects, and dependents. The goal of the diagram is to serve as a blueprint for designing a relational database that organizes and manages data efficiently.
        </p>
        <img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p1.png" alt="ER Diagram">
        <h4>Key Components and Their Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Represented by rectangles (e.g., EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, DEPENDENT), these are the objects or concepts that store data.</li>
          <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Represented by ovals (e.g., Fname, Salary, Location), these define the properties of each entity.</li>
          <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Represented by diamonds (e.g., WORKS_FOR, MANAGES, WORKS_ON), these define the connections between entities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Features:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Defined Entity Types and Relationships:</strong> Identified key entities such as EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, and DEPENDENT, and established relationships like WORKS_FOR, MANAGES, and WORKS_ON to represent real-world connections.</li>
          <li><strong>Implemented Structural Constraints:</strong> Enforced cardinality and participation constraints (e.g., 1:N, M:N) to ensure accurate representation of relationships and data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Designing Many-to-Many Relationships</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Representing relationships like WORKS_ON (between EMPLOYEE and PROJECT) while maintaining data consistency and allowing for attributes such as Hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Introduced a relationship entity with attributes and appropriate primary and foreign keys during the relational schema design phase to capture the details and eliminate redundancy.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Handling Recursive Relationships</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Modeling recursive relationships such as SUPERVISION where an EMPLOYEE supervises other employees.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Added self-referencing relationships with clear cardinality constraints (1:N) to represent the hierarchy.</p>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          Working with the employee database has been an enriching experience, helping me understand entity relationships and their interconnections, such as EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, and PROJECT through WORKS_FOR, MANAGES, and WORKS_ON. It highlighted the importance of clear cardinalities and constraints like primary and foreign keys for maintaining data integrity. I also gained valuable insights into designing recursive relationships (e.g., SUPERVISION) and weak entities (e.g., DEPENDENT), enhancing my ability to handle complex database requirements. This project improved my skills in creating normalized, robust database schemas suited for real-world applications.

        <h3>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>
        <h4>Purchase Order Database</h4>
        <p>
          This database represents a simple sales management system, consisting of four tables: CUSTOMERS, ORDERS, LINEITEMS, and ITEMS. It organizes customer information, orders placed by customers, the items included in those orders, and their details. The relationships between tables are defined using primary and foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity.
        </p>

        <h4>DDL (Data Definition Language):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p3.jpg" alt="Create Tables"> - Define the structure of the database tables (CUSTOMERS, ORDERS, LINEITEMS, ITEMS).</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p4.jpg" alt="Alter Tables"> - Modify the structure of existing tables, for example, adding a new column.</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p5.jpg" alt="Drop Tables"> - Delete tables from the database.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>DML (Data Manipulation Language):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p6.jpg" alt="Insert Data"> - Add records to the database tables.</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p7.jpg" alt="Update Data"> - Modify existing records in the database.</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p8.jpg" alt="Delete Data"> - Remove records from the database.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Aggregate Functions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p9.jpg" alt="SUM"> - Calculate the total value of items ordered.</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p10.jpg" alt="COUNT"> - Count the number of orders placed by a customer.</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p11.jpg" alt="MIN/MAX"> - Find the most expensive order item.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Nested Queries:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p12.jpg" alt="Sub-Queries"> - Use a query within another query, for example, to find customers who have ordered specific items.</li>
          <li><img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p13.jpg" alt="Nested Aggregates"> - Calculate the total order value for customers with the highest number of orders.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          Working with the orders database enhanced my understanding of SQL by teaching me how to use DDL commands to structure and organize data, and DML commands for inserting, updating, and deleting records. I gained insights into using aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT for data analysis, as well as how to work with nested and correlated subqueries for complex queries. Implementing structured queries like joins enabled me to retrieve and analyze data from multiple tables. This experience improved my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of relational databases, preparing me for more complex tasks in database management and analysis.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Normalization and Transaction Processing</h3>
        <h4>Normalization</h4>
        <img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p14.jpg" alt="Normalization">
        <img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p15.jpg" alt="Normalization">
        <p>
          Normalization is the process of organizing a database to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. It ensures that data is stored efficiently and consistently. The key goals of normalization include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminating redundancy: Reducing duplicate data across tables.</li>
          <li>Improving data integrity: Ensuring that changes in one place propagate correctly across the database.</li>
          <li>Simplifying queries: Making the data structure easier to query and maintain.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Transaction Processing</h4>
        <img src="https://github.com/shad0wcrusad3r/dbmsPortfolio/p16.jpg" alt="Transaction Processing">
        <p>
          Transaction processing ensures the integrity and reliability of operations within a database, particularly in multi-user environments. A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, adhering to the ACID properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> Ensures all parts of a transaction are completed; otherwise, none are executed.</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintains the database's state before and after a transaction.</li>
          <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Ensures transactions do not interfere with each other.</li>
          <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          Learning about normalization and transaction processing has been invaluable in understanding how databases ensure efficiency and reliability. Normalization taught me to organize data by eliminating redundancy, maintaining consistency, and simplifying queries through well-structured tables and normal forms. Transaction processing provided insights into maintaining data integrity through ACID properties, ensuring reliable operations in multi-user environments. Concepts like rollbacks and locking mechanisms highlighted how databases handle failures and prevent conflicts. Overall, these concepts enhanced my appreciation for the balance of efficiency, reliability, and accuracy in database design.
